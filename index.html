								<p> <p align="justify"> üåº‚ú®Hi, I'm Morgan! I received my Master of Science degree from Georgia State University.<a href="https://scholarworks.gsu.edu/geosciences_theses/135/"> My thesis </a> focused on the evolution of microstructures in black shale petroleum source rocks. As an environmental enthusiast, I pursued this research topic to increase efficiency in drilling efforts by improving our understanding of migration pathways, diagenesis, and kinetics at play in the mid-continental US. <br> <br>
									üåéüõ∞Ô∏èI am an Esri ArcGIS Pro certified technician and have completed Esri courses such as Fundamentals of Mapping and Visualization, Creating Python Scripts for Raster Analysis, and Data QC with ArcGIS. I am making daily strides to become a well-rounded cartographer in an environment that challenges my ability to interpret and analyze the stratigraphy of our diverse planet.
									<br><br> üå±üî≠ I currently serve as the GIS Urban Forestry Analyst for an urban forestry firm. My primary responsibility is to perform various analysis on remotely-sensed land cover data to produce a wide range of materials, including fact sheets, technical reports, custom maps, infographics, and Esri StoryMaps. One of the key aspects of my role is staying updated with the latest technologies and implementing them to support the production of urban tree canopy assessments. This includes effective spatial data management, including geoprocessing tasks, utilizing ModelBuilder, data conversions, and statistical analysis of various natural resources datasets.

In addition to my technical responsibilities, I play a vital role in fostering innovation within the company. I regularly generate fresh ideas for client solutions and continuously work on improving existing processes. I'm also involved in creating standard operating procedures and accompanying documentation to streamline our operations and ensure consistency.

Furthermore, I take on a leadership role by leading and facilitating client and stakeholder meetings and presentations. This involves effective communication both within our team and externally with clients to gather technical requirements and enhance the development of geospatial technology products and services. Overall, my role is dynamic, involving a wide array of technical skills, innovation, and client interaction to contribute effectively to natural resource management initiatives
									<br><br>  üèïÔ∏èüê¶ In my free time, you can find me hiking in the Rocky Mountains, trying to identify a bird as it zooms past or volunteering at Luvin Arms Animal Farm Sanctuary.

<p align="justify"> This factsheet was created for the town of Davidson, North Carolina, providing insights into canopy changes within the town's boundaries throughout three assessment years. This report offers a detailed distribution analysis of the current canopy across the town's watersheds and planning zones. Additionally, the report highlights a comparative analysis, shedding light on how Davidson's canopy cover stacks up against neighboring communities. </a>.

<p align="justify">  The only National Park we have here in South Carolina is Congaree. This floodplain is an idealic snapshot of the SE Coastal Plain physiographic region. In this map I displayed all of the parks trails and even hilighted the Boardwalk trail (thats the most accessible to vistors). Through the advanced symbology editor I imported images for the parks attractions.

<p align="justify">
The interpolated dissolved oxygen (DO) values of highest concern have been highlighted in red. These high-risk areas exist in the middle and upper parts of the bay. Interpolated values reflect more areas of concern in 2015 than the previous year. The ranges of contour values indicate that significant areas of Chesapeake Bay had predicted DO levels below the unhealthy level of 5.0 mg/L in areas, but no locations appear to have had average levels near the fatal level of 0.2 mg/L.
<br><br>
This hydrologic data was taken during the summer months where the DO is lowest as a function of increased water temperature (and thus decreased solubility of oxygen). Due to seasonal variation, the DO values would be expected to increase throughout the year.  Additionally, streamflow may be low due to seasonal precipitation patterns in a temperate zone such as the Chesapeake Bay. Although there is insufficient data to infer the cause of the decrease in DO potential hazards to this estuary could be: urban water runoff, fertilizers, and algae growth. </p>

								<br><br>
 I explored an USDA 2017 pumpkin dataset. Through the use of query and labeling, I highlighted the most productive counties. I had no idea that Illinois is the pumpkin capital of the US! (You still couldn't pay me to go there). It was exciting to play with the symbology and create my own graduated color scheme. However, we can all agree that the legend is the real star of the show. I started this project to stretch my adobe illustrator muscles. I hadn't opened this software since I made figures for my thesis. Although illustrator isn't exactly like riding a bike, I enjoyed troubleshooting the program.  I feel accomplished to show off the fun cartographic masterpiece!

Priority scores were assigned to each demographic to determine the allocation of trees. The focus areas are downtown Los Angeles, north of Long Beach, and directly south of San Fernando. These neighborhoods house a complex overlap and combination of the eight affected demographics. The southwest region has the highest existing tree canopy coverage due to the underdeveloped mountainous terrain and should not be prioritized. </p>

<p align="justify">  Yaaar mateys! This map was created to mimic a vintage pirate map. This background was created by making a map with a transparent background and adding layers with a paper texture. I am most proud of the vintage scale bar that was created through the use of advanced symbol editing. The division distances, marker lines, and font were altered to create an antique scale bar that would fool Mercator himself! This map illustrates that most of the shipwrecks
	occur along the south shores of Lake Superior. Of course this piece of artwork would not be possible without the inspiring tutorials of	<a href="https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/author/j_nelson/?page=10&rmedium=redirect&rsource=blogs.esri.com%2Fesri%2Farcgis%2Fauthor%2FJohn-2363"> John Nelson </a>.

<p align="justify">  The Thomas Fire devestated vegetation leaving a giant burn scar along the coast of California. The sloping topography needs vegetation to hold onto the underlying soil layers. the lack of vegetation increases landslides on steep slopes during heavy rainfall events. Vegetation density, precipitation, and slope data was queried to perform a landslide suitability analysis.

<p align="justify"> This raster model predicts the future of land subsidence and flood inundation of the Netherlands ' capital.  Numerous raster functions were utilized to fill data voids and calculate the current elevation and subsidence inside the borders of Amsterdam. This data provided a pattern that could be used to extrapolate data for 2050.  Arcade editor was used to determine that the buildings in the northeast corner of the city were most susceptible to flood damage. Modelbuilder was used to demonstrate the increase in flood depth, increased cost of damage, and predicted areas of extreme subsidence. In conclusion, 2050 will have more damage to structures by flooding. However, the most expensive buildings will have flooded long before that! So go visit those low-lying cities while you can!

Through the examination of temporal Landsat images, the dramatic decrease of Lake Poyang is undeniable. The area of the lake in 1984 was 270,000 hectares and decreased to 200,000 hectares by 2014. Nearly 70,000 hectares of Lake Poyang have been lost. This correlates to 2,300 hectares a year on average.

This dataset does not provide the causes of the decrease in the area but it does provide evidence of the change. The construction of the Three Gorges Dam and sand mining have undoubtedly had an impact on Lake Poyang. The lowering lake bed, water receding from surrounding channels, and increased suspended sediment are just a few of the hypotheses for the retreating lake border. Although there is no sound solution to solve this crisis, policymakers now have temporal data to show that there is no doubt that this vital aquatic ecosystem needs help.</p>

Proud to share my first interactive web application! I followed an Esri tutorial to display the current planned and unplanned power outages in California.
Through the use of the arcade editor and some advanced formatting, I configured pop-ups to display real-time information about power outages in California. The refresh rate for this dataset has been set to 5 minutes. Scheduled outages are denoted with a green light while unscheduled are highlighted in red.  Click <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/73dba9155e0141728357314dd50d8a98">here</a> to scroll through the dashboard to see the number of impacted customers, the time elapsed for each outage, and the name of the responding power company.
