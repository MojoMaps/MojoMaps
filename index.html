<p align="justify"> The city of Charlottesville, Virginia, was eager to explore the potential future of their urban canopy in a user-friendly way. With the help of Excel and customized parameters like tree mortality rates, annual canopy growth, and natural regeneration, I developed four easy-to-understand scenarios for the city's canopy growth over the next 30 years. This effort aimed to make it straightforward for the city to grasp what it would take to maintain their current canopy and achieve their goals for expanding urban greenery. It also provided clear, actionable insights, including the number of trees to plant each year to reach their desired canopy goals. </a>.

<p> <p align="justify"> <b>Skills used:</b> <i> ArcPro Geoprocessing tools (Data engineering, Buffer, Union, Raster Calculator, Zonal Statistics) </i> <br>
<p align="justify"> Environmental inequity, prevalent throughout the United States, is evident in challenges like unaffordable housing, restricted access to parks, and widespread impervious surfaces. For this study, six distinct socioeconomic and demographic datasets from the census were obtained and given equal importance. These datasets, along with land cover data, were integrated with urban heat island data obtained from the Landsat 8 satellite's thermal band. This combination allowed for the creation of a detailed prioritization framework for the census data of Pinellas County.

<p align="justify"> 
In Lexington County, City Council Districts were assessed and ranked based on land cover metrics. These evaluations took into account factors such as the extent of tree canopy coverage, the availability of plantable space, the utilization of such spaces for planting, and the ratio of impervious surfaces to tree canopy. Additionally, the role of trees in mitigating stormwater runoff was quantified and incorporated into a composite score for each district, providing a comprehensive measure of their environmental performance.

<p> <p align="justify"> <b>Skills used:</b> <i> Excel, ArcPro Geoprocessing tools (Clip, Spatial Join, Identity) </i> <br>
<p align="justify">  The distribution of Titusville's tree canopy is uneven across the city. Examining the canopy at finer assessment scales provides the city and its stakeholders with a clearer understanding of the spatial distribution of green spaces. By summarizing land cover metrics across the area's census block groups, specific locations can be identified for targeted future planting and maintenance efforts.

<p align="justify">  The Thomas Fire devestated vegetation leaving a giant burn scar along the coast of California. The sloping topography needs vegetation to hold onto the underlying soil layers. The lack of vegetation increases landslides on steep slopes during heavy rainfall events. Vegetation density, precipitation, and slope data was queried to perform a landslide suitability analysis.

<p align="justify"> This raster model predicts the future of land subsidence and flood inundation of the Netherlands ' capital.  Numerous raster functions were utilized to fill data voids and calculate the current elevation and subsidence inside the borders of Amsterdam. This data provided a pattern that could be used to extrapolate data for 2050.  Arcade editor was used to determine that the buildings in the northeast corner of the city were most susceptible to flood damage. Modelbuilder was used to demonstrate the increase in flood depth, increased cost of damage, and predicted areas of extreme subsidence. In conclusion, 2050 will have more damage to structures by flooding. However, the most expensive buildings will have flooded long before that! So go visit those low-lying cities while you can!

Through the examination of temporal Landsat images, the dramatic decrease of Lake Poyang is undeniable. The area of the lake in 1984 was 270,000 hectares and decreased to 200,000 hectares by 2014. Nearly 70,000 hectares of Lake Poyang have been lost. This correlates to 2,300 hectares a year on average.

This dataset does not provide the causes of the decrease in the area but it does provide evidence of the change. The construction of the Three Gorges Dam and sand mining have undoubtedly had an impact on Lake Poyang. The lowering lake bed, water receding from surrounding channels, and increased suspended sediment are just a few of the hypotheses for the retreating lake border. Although there is no sound solution to solve this crisis, policymakers now have temporal data to show that there is no doubt that this vital aquatic ecosystem needs help.</p>

The interpolated dissolved oxygen (DO) values of highest concern have been highlighted in red. These high-risk areas exist in the middle and upper parts of the bay. Interpolated values reflect more areas of concern in 2015 than the previous year. The ranges of contour values indicate that significant areas of Chesapeake Bay had predicted DO levels below the unhealthy level of 5.0 mg/L in areas, but no locations appear to have had average levels near the fatal level of 0.2 mg/L.
<br><br>
This hydrologic data was taken during the summer months where the DO is lowest as a function of increased water temperature (and thus decreased solubility of oxygen). Due to seasonal variation, the DO values would be expected to increase throughout the year.  Additionally, streamflow may be low due to seasonal precipitation patterns in a temperate zone such as the Chesapeake Bay. Although there is insufficient data to infer the cause of the decrease in DO potential hazards to this estuary could be: urban water runoff, fertilizers, and algae growth. </p>

<p align="justify">  Yaaar mateys! This map was created to mimic a vintage pirate map. This background was created by making a map with a transparent background and adding layers with a paper texture. I am most proud of the vintage scale bar that was created through the use of advanced symbol editing. The division distances, marker lines, and font were altered to create an antique scale bar that would fool Mercator himself! This map illustrates that most of the shipwrecks
	occur along the south shores of Lake Superior. Of course this piece of artwork would not be possible without the inspiring tutorials of	<a href="https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/author/j_nelson/?page=10&rmedium=redirect&rsource=blogs.esri.com%2Fesri%2Farcgis%2Fauthor%2FJohn-2363"> John Nelson </a>.
